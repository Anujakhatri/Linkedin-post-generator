You're not ‚Äúmissing an opportunity‚Äù by expecting basic respect, you‚Äôre standing in your worth.\n\nIf a company can't respect your time, your availability, or even offer basic courtesy like scheduling notice, imagine what it would be like working with them long-term. üö©\n\nHave you ever experienced a situation like this?\n\n#VirtualAssistant #Jobseekers #ExecutiveAssistant",
